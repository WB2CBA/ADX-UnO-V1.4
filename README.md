- UPDATE: 27-06-2023

- ADX UnO V1.3 is now fully open source! All SMT production files are under Production Files folder.

- I also added a Guide on how to order SMT manufactured PCBs from JLCPCB PCB production Company.

    ENJOY!:)

ADX Uno is an  Arduino Digital Modes HF Transceiver Arduino Uno Shield.

ADX UnO is an Arduino Uno based HF Digital Modes Transceiver. ADX is abbreviation for Arduino Digital Xceiver. 

ADX UnO is based on ADX – Arduino based Digital Modes Transceiver design.

Here is the link for ADX – Arduino based digital modes transceiver for further information:

ADX UnO is a mono band digital modes optimized HF transceiver that can be plugged on top of an Arduino Uno board to create a 3.5 watts average RF Output power QRP portable HF Digital Modes capable transceiver.  

ADX UnO can cover four pre-programmed bands one band at a time by swapping Band LPF Filter Modules. 

It can operate on any of the pre-programmed four bands of 80m,40m,30m,20m, 17m, 15m and 10m bands and operates on four of the most popular digital modes, FT8, FT4, JS8call and WSPR.
